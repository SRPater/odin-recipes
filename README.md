# Odin Recipes

This is a simple project from The Odin Project to practice everything I've learned so far about HTML. I already know a lot of HTML, but The Odin Project said not to skip anything, so I'm doing this. It'll probably cover the HTML boilerplate, head and body tags, headers, paragraphs, lists, links and images.
