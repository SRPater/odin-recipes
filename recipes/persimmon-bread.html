  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>As far as fall baking goes, there are other flavors that hog the limelight (we're looking at you, pumpkin spice!). The humble persimmon is oft forgotten, except by those who already love its honey-like flavor and know that it is only available to enjoy during a short season.</p>

  <p>Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon. For 1 cup of persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on their size. You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically take longer to fully ripen than hachiya.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1½ cups of all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¾ cup of white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>½ cup of vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 cup of persimmon pulp</li>
    <li>½ cup of chopped walnuts</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
    <li>½ cup of raisins</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
