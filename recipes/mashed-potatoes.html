  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These make-ahead mashed potatoes are rich, creamy, and smooth. You can do nearly everything up to two days ahead - a great option to give you a few extra hours on those big holidays. Adding butter after you reheat them makes them taste freshly mashed.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 pounds of russet potatoes, scrubbed but unpeeled</li>
    <li>1½ cups half-and-half</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons of butter, softened</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat half-and-half in the microwave until just warm.
    </li>
    <li>
      Process unpeeled potatoes through a food mill into a medium bowl. (Or, using a potholder, peel and drop them into a bowl. Puree using a potato masher or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.) Stir in warm half-and-half and salt (or beat, if using a mixer) until smooth and fluffy. Cool, cover, and refrigerate potatoes in a microwave-safe, airtight container for up to 2 days.
    </li>
    <li>
      Thirty minutes before serving, microwave until warm. Transfer to a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir in butter to melt. Cover and keep warm.
    </li>
  </ol>
